The timeless classic Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic has appeared on the iOS App Store, ten years after it was first released on Xbox in July 2003. I’m only a couple of hours in, but it seems like a solid port so far. It’s yours for [$9.99](https://itunes.apple.com/se/app/star-wars-knights-old-republic/id611436052?mt=8).
