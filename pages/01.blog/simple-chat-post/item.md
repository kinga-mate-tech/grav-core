**Blake**: What’s the problem, pal?

**Dave Moss**: Moss. You’re such a hero, you’re so rich, how come you’re coming down here wasting your time with such a bunch of bums?

**Blake**: You see this watch? You see this watch?

**Dave Moss**: Yeah.

**Blake**: That watch costs more than you car. I made $970,000 last year. How much you make? You see pal, that’s who I am, and you’re nothing. Nice guy? I don’t give a shit. Good father? ----- you! Go home and play with your kids. You wanna work here – close! You think this is abuse? You think this is abuse, you ----------? You can’t take this, how can you take the abuse you get on a sit? You don’t like it, leave.
