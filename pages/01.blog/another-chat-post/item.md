**Evelyn Mulwray**: Tell me, Mr. Gittes: Does this often happen to you?

**Jake Gittes**: What’s that?

**Evelyn Mulwray**: Well, I’m judging only on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but, uh, if this is how you go about your work, I’d say you’d be lucky to, uh, get through a whole day.

**Jake Gittes**: Actually, this hasn’t happened to me for a long time.

**Evelyn Mulwray**: When was the last time?

**Jake Gittes**: Why?

**Evelyn Mulwray**: It’s an innocent question.

**Jake Gittes**: In Chinatown.

**Evelyn Mulwray**: What were you doing there?

**Jake Gittes**: Working for the District Attorney.

**Evelyn Mulwray**: Doing what?

**Jake Gittes**: As little as possible.

**Evelyn Mulwray**: The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?

**Jake Gittes**: They do in Chinatown.
