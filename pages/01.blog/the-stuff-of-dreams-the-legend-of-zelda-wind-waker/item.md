The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, released in Japan as ゼルダの伝説 風のタクト, is an action-adventure game and the tenth installment in The Legend of Zelda series. The game is set on a group of islands in a vast sea—a first for the series. The player controls Link, the protagonist of the Zelda series. He struggles against his nemesis, Ganondorf, for control of a sacred relic known as the Triforce.

Music from the admirable people of the [Zelda Reorchestrated project](http://www.zreomusic.com/).
